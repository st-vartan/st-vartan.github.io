After that it is a very slow process for me to get familiar with hoopers on this court.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                I avoid fake friendliness or being unwillingly social on a basketball court. Life is so short and time is\n                precious, so I stay sincere and honest to the very myself by getting to know people only who I appreciate\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Talented hoopers on this court make me a better player. I come to realize things much more important than winning/losing\n                games or basketball skills: trust, tolerance and support from teammates. To me, that's the best part of basketball.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                I build this site all because of my great enthuism for St.Vartan hoops.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\n            {/* Work Gallery */}\n            <div className=\"work-full-media mt-0 white-shadow wow fadeInUp\">\n              <ul className=\"clearlist work-full-slider owl-carousel\">\n                <li>\n                  <img src=\"/static/images/about/5bro.jpg\" alt=\"5 Bro\" />\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default speech;\n"],"mappings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sourceRoot":""}
