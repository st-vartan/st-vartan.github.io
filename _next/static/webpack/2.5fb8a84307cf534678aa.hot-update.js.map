After that it is a very slow process for me to get familiar with hoopers on this court.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Talented hoopers on this court make me a better player. Having runing with them, I come to realize things that are much more important than winning/losing\n                games or basketball skills: trust, tolerance and support from teammates. To me, that's the best part of basketball.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Yes!
